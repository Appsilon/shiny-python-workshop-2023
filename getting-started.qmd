```
# Goal 

The goal of this section is to learn what you need to do to stand up a Shiny application.
Don't worry if you don't really understand how the framework works, or why it's designed in a particular way. 
All we're tryign to do at this stage is to get something working, and become comfortable with the development pattern.


# Create an app

Shiny apps are divided into two parts.
The app *UI* consists of various input and output components, and the *server* expresses how those inputs and outputs should interact. 

Let's start by creating a basic shiny app
To do this you can call `shiny create .` in a project folder, or open up `apps/basic-app` in the repo. 
You'll generate the simplest possible Shiny application with one input and one output. 

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

include_shiny_folder("apps/basic-app")
```
