## Goals of Session 1

1) Understand the mechanics of a Shiny app (what to do, not why you do it)
2) Develop comfort with failure and debugging
3) You know where to go for help 

## Pedagogy

- This session is going to be exercise based
- We want to get into trouble
- Don't worry about understanding, just get things working 


## Exercises
- All of the exercises and slides are running live on the [website](https://rstudio.github.io/shiny-python-workshop-2023/)
- You can do them on the website or open the apps in the `apps/problem-sets` folder

## Testing your setup

1) In a terminal type `shiny create my-app`
2) Open `my-app/app.py`
3) Click the "run app" button in the top right of VS Code
4) If your local setup doesn't work
